Copy/paste the output of your simulation when using planets.txt,
running the simulation for 1,000,000 (one  million) seconds, and
with a time-step/dt value of 25,000

Copy/paste the output of your simulation when using planets.txt,
running the simulation for 2,000,000 (two  million) seconds, and
with a time-step/dt value of 25,000

(replace with copy/paste)

Run the simulation for a billion seconds (10^9) and a time-step/dt
of a million. You should see behavior inconsistent with what is
expected for celestial bodies. This is due to large values of dt
when approximating forces. Write down below what you see during
this simulation.

(replace with observed behavior)
