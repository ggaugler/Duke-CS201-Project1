# Duke-CS201-Project2

From the assignment description:

Write a program to simulate the motion of N objects in a plane, mutually affected by gravitational forces, and animate the results. Such methods are widely used in cosmology, semiconductors, and fluid dynamics to study complex physical systems. Ultimately, you will be creating a program NBody.java that draws an animation of bodies floating around in space tugging on each other with the power of gravity.
